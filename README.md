# react-reality-cli

Command line interface for react-reality projects

# Installation

```bash
yarn global add react-reality-cli
```

or

```bash
npm i g react-reality-cli
```

# Usage

## init

Create a new react-reality project

```bash
react-reality init myproject
```

or use the short alias:

```bash
rr init myproject
```

**Fun Fact** You can use `rr` as an alias for any of your `react-native` commands. `rr run-ios` helps, and is shorter!
